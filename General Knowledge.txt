What is the difference between context API and redux?

The main difference between the Context API and Redux is that the Context API is built into React and is focused on providing a way to pass data  
through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Redux, on the other hand, is an external library that provides  
a centralized state management solution and is used for more complex applications that require a global state.  

what is redux toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is a new official library from the Redux team that is intended to make it easier to write applications with Redux.  
It provides a set of tools and APIs that make it easier to write Redux logic, such as creating reducers, composing reducers, creating action creators,  
and much more. It also includes several other features, such as support for middleware and data fetching.
